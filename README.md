# Voice Assistant - Python Project

## Overview
This project is a simple **Voice Assistant** built using Python. The assistant can listen to voice commands, recognize them, and execute tasks such as web browsing, taking screenshots, opening applications, and more. The assistant uses the `pyttsx3` library for text-to-speech, `speech_recognition` for speech-to-text, and `pyautogui` for simulating keyboard and mouse actions.

## Features
- **Web Navigation**: Open YouTube, perform Google searches, and open Gmail.
- **Desktop Actions**: Take screenshots, simulate typing, press Enter, and control applications like Calculator and Notepad.
- **System Control**: Open Chrome, refresh the page, and shut down the system.
- **Time and Date**: Get the current time and date.
- **Custom Commands**: Easily extendable for additional commands and functionalities.
